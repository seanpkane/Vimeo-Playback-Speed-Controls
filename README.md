# Vimeo-Playback-Speed-Controls
This Chrome plugin allows users to set the playback speed of both native (vimeo.com) and embedded Vimeo-based videos.

###Purpose and Testing
This plugin was specifically designed and tested for [ClinCalc Academy](https://clincalc.com/academy) to increase playback speed of embedded educational videos.  The playback speed controls will be enabled on other websites, although extensive testing has not been done. 

###Attribution
This project is forked from [rudiedirkx/Vimeo-repeat](https://github.com/rudiedirkx/Vimeo-repeat) -- major changes include the ability to modify embedded videos on third-party websites and an alternative interface for selecting video speeds using icons (rather than keyboard input).
